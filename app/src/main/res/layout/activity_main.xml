不是生与死的距离 is not the way from birth to the end.
而是我就站在你面前It is when I stand in front of you
你却不知道我爱你 but you don't understand I love you.
世界上最遥远的距离 The furthest distance in the world
不是我就站在你面前 is not when I stand in front of you
你却不知道我爱你 you don't know I love you
而是爱到痴迷 It is when my love is bewildering the soul
却不能说我爱你 but I can't speak it out
世界上最遥远的距离 The furthest distance in the world
不是我不能说我爱你 is not that I can't say I love you.
而是想你痛彻心脾 It is after missing you deeply into my heart
却只能深埋心底 I only can bury it in my heart
世界上最遥远的距离The furthest distance in the world
不是我不能说我想你 is not that I can't say to you I miss you
而是彼此相爱 It is when we are falling in love
却不能够在一起 but we can't stay nearby
世界上最遥远的距离 The furthest distance in the world
不是彼此相爱 is not we love each other .
却不能够在一起 but can't stay together
而是明知道真爱无敌 .It is we know our true love is breaking through the way
却装作毫不在意 we turn a blind eye to it
所以世界上最遥远的距离 So the furthest distance in the world
不是树与树的距离 is not in two distant trees.
而是同根生长的树枝 It is the same rooted branches
却无法在风中相依 but can't depend on each other in the wind
世界上最遥远的距离The furthest distance in the world
不是树枝无法相依 is not can't depend on each other in the wind
而是相互瞭望的星星 It is in the blinking stars who only can look with each other
却没有交汇的轨迹 but their trade intersect.
世界上最遥远的距离The furthest distance in the world
不是星星没有交汇的轨迹 is not in the blinking stars who only can look with each other
而是纵然轨迹交汇 It is after the intersection
却在转瞬间无处寻觅 but they can't be found from then on afar
世界上最遥远的距离The furthest distance in the world
不是瞬间便无处寻觅 is not the light that is fading away.
而是尚未相遇 It is the coincidence of us
便注定无法相聚 is not supposed for the love.
世界上最遥远的距离The furthest distance in the world
是飞鸟与鱼的距离 is the love between the bird and fish.
一个翱翔天际 One is flying in the sky,
一个却深潜海底 the other is looking upon into the sea."
